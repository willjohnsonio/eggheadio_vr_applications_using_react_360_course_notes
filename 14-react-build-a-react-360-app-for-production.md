Now we are finished with our app, we can build it and enter into production. First do ```<npm run bundle>```

One that is done we'll build a new build folder inside of our project directory. we also need to copy the static assets into the build directory. ```<cp -rf static_assets build>```

Once that's done we can run a production build ```<http-serve build>```

Copy the URL in the browser and we'll see our app with no develper warnings


## Personal Take:
Nothing to say just deploying
