This repo contains notes taken from Tomasz ≈Åakomy's [React 360 course](https://egghead.io/courses/vr-applications-using-react-360).

This course will walk you through building a travel app in VR usting React 360. Each video will introduce a new concept and implement it into a real working app. When you are finished with the workshop you should have working knowledge of the basics of React 360.

There is a link to the video at the top and a link to resources at the bottom. Most of it is a transcription, with a few added points for clarification. This is a public resource so you can add and update or futher clarify
